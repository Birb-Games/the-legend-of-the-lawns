# As a workaround to an issue that we found in which the particle seems to cause
# a lag spike when first instantiated.
# The fix was to instantiate the particle for one time in the main scene at the
# beginning of the game to avoid lag spikes afterwards - this particle is marked
# with the `first_instance` flag (all other particles should have this flag set
# to false) - if this flag is set to true, the particle's text is set to an
# empty string so that it is not visible and then activated so that whatever
# Godot needs to do in order to eliminate the lag spike is done at the start
# of the game, not during a less desirable time, such as during gameplay.
