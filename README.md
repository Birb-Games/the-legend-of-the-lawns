# The Legend of the Lawns
### The Quest for a Swapdeck

The new Swapdeck portable game console just came out this summer and you want to
get it - unfortunately you weren't able to convince your parents to get it for
you so now you have to mow your neighbors's lawns in order to get enough money.

It turns out mowing lawns is a lot more difficult - and dangerous - than you
initially thought. Can you survive killer weeds, angry flowers, and other
yard hazards and emerge victorious with your brand new Swapdeck or will you
succumb to the dangers of your neighbor Bob's backyard?

**This game is still a work in progress, we still have to implement more features
and there might be some bugs/issues that need to be fixed.**

## Name

This game's official name is *The Legend of the Lawns: The Quest for a Swapdeck*
though it can also be referred to as "The Legend of the Lawns" or 
"Legend of the Lawns". An appropriate acronym would be "LotL".

"LoL" might be okay but that leaves out the "the" in the name and also might be
confused with *League of Legends*. On second thought, just go with LotL.
